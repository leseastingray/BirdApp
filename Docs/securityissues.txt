Comments:
Many of these security issues are the same that show up every time. 
I tried to mitigate the X-Frame-Options Header Not Set, but it crashes my app when I add the additional code in Startup. The app appears to recognize an already existing key value to the mitigation feature.
I also worked on the Cross Site Scripting (Reflected) issue. Originally it occurred in three places: EditBird, DeleteBird, and Login.
I mitigated the issue at DeleteBird, but was not able to at EditBird or Login.
